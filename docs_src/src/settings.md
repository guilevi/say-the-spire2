# Settings

Press **Ctrl+M** (keyboard), **LT+Start** (Xbox), or **L2+Options** (PS5) to open the mod settings screen from anywhere in the game.

## Top-Level Categories

- **Advanced** — Verbose Logging and Performance Profiling toggles for debugging the mod itself, plus the **UI Enhancements** sub-category (toggles for individual UI improvements the mod adds — auto-focus, bundle preview, keep summons focusable, and so on, one entry per affected screen).
- **Map** — map navigation behavior (auto-advance to choice nodes, read intermediate nodes when going backward, announce current location when the map opens), with a **Points of Interest** sub-category for which POI types are exposed when navigating by POI (Elite, Shop, Treasure, Rest Site, Boss, Ancient, Quest-marked, etc.).
- **Speech** — which speech backend the mod uses, plus per-backend tuning (rate, volume, voice).
- **Announcements** — global toggles for each announcement type (Tooltip, Position, etc.) and any settings the announcement type itself exposes (e.g. Verbose mode, Include Prefix). These are the defaults that per-element, per-buffer, and per-hotkey overrides all inherit from.
- **UI** — a tree with one entry per element type the mod knows about (Creature, Card, Relic, Potion, Map Node, etc.). Each entry has its own Announcements list where you can override the globals just for that element type and reorder how its announcements are spoken.
- **Buffers** — one entry per browsable list the mod maintains (Card, Creature, Relic, Potion, Player, Character, Lobby). Each has its own Announcements list — the same kind of override-and-reorder screen as the UI element types, but controlling what's spoken when you browse that buffer rather than when you focus an element. See [Buffer Announcements](#buffer-announcements).
- **Hotkey Announcements** — one entry per "announce" hotkey (Announce HP, Announce Block, Announce Gold, and so on), each showing its current key binding in its label. Lets you override that hotkey's announcement options independently of your focus and buffer settings. See [Hotkey Announcements](#hotkey-announcements).
- **Events** — one entry per event the mod can announce (cards played, HP changes, gold gained, turn changes, etc.), visually grouped into Combat, Cards, Resources, Multiplayer, and Other. See [Event Settings](#event-settings).
- **Keybindings** — every action the mod exposes, grouped into categories (Combat, Map, Markers, Buffers, Navigation, Run Information, etc.). See [Keybindings](#keybindings).

## Per-Element Announcement Overrides

Every UI element type (creature, card, relic, potion, map node, etc.) has its own **Announcements** list under **UI**. The list contains one entry per announcement that element supports — for example a creature's announcements include Label, Type, HP, Block, Energy, Stars, Cards in Hand, Monster Intents, and so on, in the order they're spoken when you focus the element.

### What's on an element's Announcements screen

The first item on the screen is a **Reset to defaults** button. Activating it clears every override under that element back to "inherit", and restores the original announcement order.

After that comes one row per announcement. Each row is a horizontal group of three buttons:

1. **Configure** — opens a screen with that announcement's settings. The settings are the same ones you see at the global level (Announce, Verbose, Include Prefix, etc.), but rendered as per-element overrides — they inherit from the global setting until you change one, after which they remember your explicit choice for this element type only. There is also a Reset to defaults button at the top of the configure screen, that resets only that announcement back to inheriting.
2. **Move Up** — moves this row above the row before it. Focus stays on the Move Up button so you can press it repeatedly to keep moving the row up.
3. **Move Down** — same, but downward.

When you arrow up or down onto a row, the mod announces the row name (e.g. "Label horizontal bar"), the focused button within the row, and the row's position in the list (e.g. "1 of 9"). Use Left and Right to move between the three buttons within the row.

When you move a row, the mod tells you where it landed — "moved between Block and Energy", "moved before Type", "moved after Cards in Hand", etc. The new order is saved immediately and persists across game launches. Adding new announcement types in a future mod update will slot them into your saved order at their canonical position rather than dumping them at the bottom.

## Buffer Announcements

The browsable lists you page through with the buffer controls — cards, creatures, players, relics, potions, characters, and the multiplayer lobby — are configured the same way as UI elements, but under the **Buffers** category instead of **UI**.

Each buffer has its own **Announcements** list that behaves exactly like the per-element screen described above: one row per announcement, each a horizontal group of **Configure**, **Move Up**, and **Move Down**, with a **Reset to defaults** button at the top.

The difference is *when* these settings apply. A buffer's Announcements control what's spoken as you browse that buffer, separately from what's spoken when you focus the same kind of element directly. So you can, for instance, keep a card's focus readout terse while having the card buffer include its full description, or turn an individual announcement off so it's skipped entirely while browsing — all without touching the focus string. As with per-element overrides, each setting inherits from the global announcement default until you change it.

## Hotkey Announcements

The **Hotkey Announcements** category lists every "announce" hotkey — the keys that read out a single piece of information on demand (Announce HP, Announce Resources, Announce Gold, Announce Block, Announce Powers, Announce Intents, Announce Summarized Intents, Announce Boss, Announce Relic Counters).

Each entry's label shows the action together with its current key binding — for example "Announce Block: Ctrl+B" — and updates automatically when you rebind the key or switch language. The entries are listed alphabetically by label.

Opening an entry lets you override that hotkey's announcement options — most commonly its **Verbose** toggle — independently of the same announcement's focus and buffer settings. That means you can make Announce Block read a terse "5" on its hotkey while your focus string still says "5 block". Hotkeys whose announcement has no options still appear in the list so you can see their binding, but have nothing to configure inside. These overrides inherit from the global announcement defaults like every other override screen.

## Event Settings

Each event type has its own category with at least:

- **Announce** — speak the event when it happens.
- **Add to buffer** — log it into the events buffer so you can review it later with the buffer controls.

Some events expose extra settings on top of those, like **Include Totals** (running totals on Block/Gold) or **Show Round Number** (on the Player Turn Start event).

### Source Filtering

Events that involve a creature have a **Sources** sub-category with toggles for who's allowed to trigger an announcement:

- **Current Player** — your own actions
- **Other Players** — other players' actions in multiplayer
- **Enemies** — enemy actions

The mod only shows source toggles the game itself provides visual feedback for, so different events will have different combinations of these.

## Speech Settings

The speech category controls how the mod talks to you.

- **Speech Handler** — picks the speech backend. Auto picks the first one that's working on your system. Prism is a unified abstraction that talks to NVDA, JAWS, SAPI, OneCore, etc. behind the scenes. SAPI uses Windows' built-in speech directly. Clipboard copies output to the clipboard instead of speaking it.
- **Per-handler settings** — appear underneath. Prism has a Backend dropdown (which screen reader / TTS engine to pin it to); on macOS, where Prism's AVSpeech backend provides direct TTS control, it also gets Rate and Voice (the Voice list includes each voice's language, since some systems have multiple same-named voices for different variants). SAPI has Rate, Volume, and Voice.

## Keybindings

The Keybindings category holds every action the mod exposes, grouped by purpose (Combat, Map, Markers, Buffers, Navigation, Run Information, Mod, etc.). Each action is a button that opens a binding list screen for that action.

On a binding list screen you can:

- **Add Keyboard Binding** — listens for a keystroke to add as a new binding for this action.
- **Add Controller Binding** — listens for a controller button.
- **Replace** — replaces an existing binding for this action with a new one.
- **Delete** — removes a binding.

Every action can have any number of keyboard or controller bindings. There's also a top-level **Reset to defaults** button on the Keybindings screen if you want to wipe your changes.
